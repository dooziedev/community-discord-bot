# community-discord-bot
A simple base for a community Discord bot written in python.

Steps to configure the bot.

Requirements:
-Python 3.9+
-Discord.py library. ("pip install discord" in your terminal)

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and create a new application. After creating the application, go to the bot tab and get your bot's token.
2. After getting your bot's token, paste your token in place of "YOUR TOKEN" text. Do not remove the '' signs.
3. You can now run the bot by using "py main.py" on windows or "python3" UNIX/GNU based systems. (Keep in mind that you have to be in the same directory as your bot's files.)
